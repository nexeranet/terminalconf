gettext is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because macOS provides the BSD gettext library & some software gets confused if both are in the library path.

If you need to have gettext first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/gettext/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find gettext you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/gettext/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/gettext/include"
